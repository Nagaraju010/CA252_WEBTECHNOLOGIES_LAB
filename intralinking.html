Jump to What is the Difference Between Inter- and Intra? - Intra- is a prefix used to form words that mean on the inside, within. Contrast this with inter- and you immediately see the difference. While inter- deals with open systems among groups, intra- deals with closed systems between a single group. Let's reconsider some of our above examples.

Unlike Java and C++, Python is a dynamically typed language, as there is no
advance declaration associating an identifier with a particular data type. An identifier
can be associated with any type of object, and it can later be reassigned to
another object of the same (or different) type. Although an identifier has no declared
type, the object to which it refers has a definite type. In our first example,
the characters 98.6 are recognized as a floating-point literal, and thus the identifier
temperature is associated with an instance of the float class having that value.
A programmer can establish an alias by assigning a second identifier to an
existing object. Continuing with our earlier example, Figure 1.2 portrays the result
of a subsequent assignment, original = temperature

The expression to the left of the dot identifies the object upon which the method
is invoked. Often, this will be an identifier (e.g., data), but we can use the dot operator
to invoke a method upon the immediate result of some other operation. For
example, if response identifies a string instance (we will discuss strings later in this
section), the syntax response.lower( ).startswith( y ) first evaluates the method
call, response.lower( ), which itself returns a new string instance, and then the
startswith( y ) method is called on that intermediate string.
When using a method of a class, it is important to understand its behavior.
Some methods return information about the state of an object, but do not change
that state. These are known as accessors. Other methods, such as the sort method
of the list class, do change the state of an object.
